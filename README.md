hey everyone. just updating yall on whats going on. i have good news, and bad news too.

lets start off with the good news. i have been waiting, and waiting, and i am finally (finally), getting a PC in (june? may? my mom cant decide), so yeah there will be more stuff coming with that. but another thing is ive been thinking, and i thought that you guys deserved this, so im gonna do it. im gonna link my twitch. you guys deserve to watch me stream, even if its just FNF or beat saber, its fun. thought you all would enjoy it :)



bad news. there have been some issues going on in my life, and some of them im not gonna talk about, but im gonna say the others.

1st issue. there was this rumor spreading around my school that i would s**t someone nudes, and i sure as hell didnt, and they thought that only cause i was talking to a girl (whos my friend, i have a GF already) in my wellness class while we were waiting for the bell. they started harassing me, saying "hey (not gonna put my name here for a while.) you get any ass pics in your snap DM's lately?" and i would respond with "hell no, leave me alone." and it finally stopped yesterday, but its not gonna leave my mind for a while, and some of the things they said about me were not kind, and i'm not gonna say em, because my acc would get TOS'd.

2nd issue. i've been dealing with family problems lately. my dad decided to be an asshole and call me useless. that just impacted me to the core. i was so mad and very upset at the same time. its why i took a break from stuff for a while. another thing, he and my mom got into a fight, and i overheard it, and he said that he didnt wish he married her. 2 days later, it resolved, (they're still married), but god that hurt me, even if i wasnt involved in this.

3rd and last issue. there have been some things going on, and i haven't been able to finish my shaggy port. my life changed. so thats why i havent been working on it that much. another thing is that my GF got harrassed by the people i mentioned in the 1st issue, and i told her the truth, that i didn't, and she was okay with it, but the thing is, they never stopped. they stopped when it stopped for me, but we both were very heartbroken about the things they said about us. the things they said about her were worse, and they said them to her face. i've never seen her cry as much as she did.



i'm sorry for being AFK for a long long time, but this is the reason why. im coming back, soon. dont worry. 


love you all. <3


P.S, anything you guys wanna talk about, feel free to make an issue, and ill talk.
